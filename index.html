    <p>Not just a great valley, but a shrine to human foresight, the strength of granite, 
      the power of glaciers, the persistence of life, and the tranquility of the High Sierra. </p>
      
    <p>First protected in 1864, Yosemite National Park is best known for its waterfalls, 
      but within its nearly 1,200 square miles, you can find deep valleys, grand meadows, 
      ancient giant sequoias, a vast wilderness area, and much more.</p>

    <p>Fire is a natural and essential part of Yosemite. 
        We manage fire carefully and study how it interacts with the park’s ecosystems. 
        This blog provides updates about fires in Yosemite. Check for <strong>current fire restrictions.</strong></p>

      <p>We strongly recommend that you make reservations for lodging, camping, and backpacking. 
        You can pay the <strong>park entrance fee </strong> upon arrival (there's no need to pay it in advance). </p>
